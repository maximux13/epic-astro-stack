## Theme System and Color Conventions

Our project employs a dual-theme system (light and dark) enhanced by semantic color variables. This setup promotes consistency, accessibility, and ease of use across the application.

### Defining Semantic Colors

Our colors are defined with a purpose, reflecting the role they play within the UI:

- **Primary and Secondary Colors:** Colors that represent the brand and are used for interactive elements like buttons and links. Defined as `--primary` and `--secondary`.
- **Background and Foreground:** Core colors for background (`--background`) and text (`--foreground`) to ensure readability and contrast.
- **Border and Input Fields:** Colors (`--border` and `--input`) to subtly distinguish UI elements from the background, clarifying boundaries.

### Theme Implementation

Themes are applied using CSS variables, allowing for dynamic switching between light and dark modes:

```css
/* Light theme */
:root {
  --background: #fff;
  --foreground: #333;
  ...
}

/* Dark theme */
.dark {
  --background: #333;
  --foreground: #fff;
  ...
}
```

A JavaScript function toggles the `.dark` class on the root element to switch themes, respecting user preferences.

### Accessibility Considerations

We prioritize accessibility, ensuring our color scheme adheres to WCAG standards:

- **Contrast Ratios:** We aim for a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text to background and 7:1 for AAA compliance.
- **Tools for Checking Contrast:** We use tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker to evaluate and ensure our color combinations meet accessibility standards.

### Best Practices

To maintain a high-quality design and development process, we follow these best practices:

- **Use Meaningful Names:** Our color variables are semantically named to reflect their function within the UI, such as `--header-background` or `--footer-foreground`.
- **Maintain Contrast:** Regular checks of contrast ratios are conducted, especially after any color adjustments, to ensure accessibility and readability.
- **Document Changes:** A changelog of color scheme modifications is maintained to track the evolution of our design system and the rationale behind changes.

### Conclusion

By adhering to these guidelines and conventions, our application achieves a balance between aesthetic appeal, user preference adaptability, and accessibility. This comprehensive approach ensures a cohesive and accessible user experience across all parts of the application.
