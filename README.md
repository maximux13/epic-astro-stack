## Requirements üìã

Before you begin working with "Epic Astro Stack," ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher. Node.js is essential as it serves as the runtime environment for this project. It's recommended to use the latest stable version for optimal performance and feature availability.

- **pnpm**: This project uses pnpm as the package manager. pnpm is known for its efficiency and speed, and it helps in managing dependencies in a more performant way compared to npm or Yarn.

Ensure that these tools are installed and properly configured on your system to take full advantage of what "Epic Astro Stack" has to offer.

## Getting Started üöÄ

Set up your project easily with `pnpm install`. Use `pnpm run dev` for development, `pnpm run build` for production, and `pnpm preview` to preview the build. Test your application with `pnpm test` for unit tests and `pnpm test:e2e` for integration tests.

1. Install Dependencies

In the root directory of your project, run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will ensure that all packages required by "Epic Astro Stack" are properly installed.

2. Start Development Server

To start the development server, execute:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will launch the Astro development server, and your project will be accessible at `http://localhost:4321`. You can now view and interact with your project in real-time.

3. Building for Production

When your project is ready for production, run:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This command generates a production-ready build of your project, optimizing it for peak performance.

4. Previewing Production Build

To preview the production build on your local machine, use:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

This command serves your production build locally, allowing you to review and test the final output before deployment.

5. Running Tests

For testing, "Epic Astro Stack" provides separate commands for unit and integration tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Run unit tests using Vitest by executing:

  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```

- **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests with Playwright using:

  ```bash
  pnpm test:e2e
  ```
